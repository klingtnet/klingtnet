1. You're not clever.
2. ~~Distributed systems rule #1: _Do not distribute the system!_.~~  At some point of scale this is often unavoidable, but be aware of the complexity that comes with a distributed system.
3. Do not micro optimize.
4. Measure where your program spends time.
5. Optimization rule #1: _Reduce I/O_.
6. Should I use a distributed cache? Only if you are aware of the error cases and how to mitigate them!
7. > A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. [Gall's Law]
